This was my Virtual Internship Programm experience, working as a Java Developer. All thanks to Oasis Infobytes for giving me this opportunity to work with them as a Java Programmer intern in this month of June-July.

# Oasis Java Internship Task

This repository contains two tasks for the Oasis Java Internship. The tasks are designed to assess your knowledge and skills in Java programming.

## Task 1: ATM Machine

The second task is to implement an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation. The ATM machine should allow users to perform the following operations:

1. Transactions: Users should be able to check their transactions.
2. Withdraw money: Users should be able to withdraw money from their account.
3. Deposit money: Users should be able to deposit money into their account.
4. Transfer money: Users should be able to transfer money from their account to another account.

## Task 2: Number Guessing Game

The first task is to implement a number guessing game. The game should generate a random number between a specified range and prompt the user to guess the number. The user should be given attempts to guess the correct number. The game should provide feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high or too low. If the user guesses the correct number they win the game.
